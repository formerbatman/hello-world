# hello-world

Hello people of Gotham:

This is my first time on Github as I was trying to open an account on freecodecamp and I landed up here. I learning programming. I did learn C 7 years back and I have started to learn Python. In mean time I am refining my C knowledge. I hope I will improve my programming skills gradually. Looking forward to it.
